# Overview
This case study focuses on a business challenge faced by a retail company looking to expand its private-label confectionery assortment. The project team was divided on whether to introduce a cookie-based sweet or a fruit gummy variation. To support the decision-making process, market research was conducted to analyze the popularity of different types of sweets.

I received this case study twice, in 2021 and 2025. As part of this case study, I was tasked with analyzing the market research data to determine the impact of various product features on consumer preferences. Based on this analysis, I provided a data-driven recommendation for the optimal features of a new confectionery product.
My recommendation in 2021 was *SlacSnack*, a candy containing chocolate, fruit, nuts and cookie. In 2025, I recommended *Berry Nut Delight* with similar features.

# Data

# Deliverables
You will find two scripts in the folder `scripts` and two different output folders in the folder `output`, one for each year, 2021 and 2025. The results of the analysis are presented in a concise, management-friendly power point presentation, structured as follows:

- Management Summary: Key insights and final recommendation
- Methodology and Assumptions: Approach and underlying assumptions
- Detailed Analysis: Insights, methodology, and data-driven findings

The analysis was conducted using R, but other tools such as Python, SPSS, Stata, or Excel could have been used as well. In 2025, the deliverable presentation was only a management summary.

# Key Focus
The primary objective was to bridge business strategy with data analytics to support a well-informed product decision. The case study demonstrates how data-driven insights can aid in strategic decision-making for product development in the retail sector.
