# Overview
This case study focuses on a business challenge faced by a retail company looking to expand its private-label confectionery assortment. The project team was divided on whether to introduce a cookie-based sweet or a fruit gummy variation. To support the decision-making process, market research was conducted to analyze the popularity of different types of sweets.

As part of this case study, I was tasked with analyzing the market research data to determine the impact of various product characteristics on consumer preferences. Based on this analysis, I provided a data-driven recommendation for the optimal characteristics of a new confectionery product.
My recommendation was *SlacSnack*, a candy containing chocolate, fruit, nuts and cookie.
